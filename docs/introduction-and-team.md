# Introduction & Team

Our goal at GraphLinq is to provide a way to interact with the blockchain with any connected systems as effortlessly as possible, without knowing how to code.

Setting up bots or basic scripted logic, arbitrages on DEX or trading on a centralized exchange — we build the tools to boost the adoption of decentralization. Every business has logic that can be automated — we make it possible through monitoring and execution over multi-blockchain data.

In this documentation, you will find the basic knowledge of the GraphLinq Protocol and you will get a better idea of how things work.

## What exactly is GraphLinq and what is our vision?

GraphLinq is a set of tools including an IDE and an engine which run simultaneously with multiple blockchains and centralized data streams to offer a service of automatization of a process without any coding skills required.

You can use our GLQ token to run a graph on our testnet or our mainnet to execute different processes over the blockchain to automate your tasks, like easily watching Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum transactions, triggering events or doing conditional regular expressions. Everything is possible by just drag-and-dropping a few nodes on our [GraphLinq IDE](https://ide.graphlinq.io).

We believe that a lot of tasks run on mainstream crypto projects can be automated with node graphs, so that the data can be listened to, triggered and saved to a safe place, accessible for maintaining service from an off-chain side, with less fees and complexity.

## What is a graph and how does it work?

A graph is a set of attached nodes which automate on-chain and off-chain tasks. Using the [GraphLinq IDE](https://ide.graphlinq.io), you are able to import any graph file (.glq file) or templates from our listed base graphs. Once you're up and ready to deploy your own graph, head over to our [dashboard](https://app.graphlinq.io) to upload and execute it on the protocol.

## How can I run graphs on the engine? Do I need a wallet?

Every execution on a node costs a tiny amount of GLQ tokens. We call these costs **gas**. These GLQ tokens are burnt and removed from the supply, which makes GLQ a deflationary token.

To fund your node with GLQ tokens, login on our [dashboard](https://app.graphlinq.io) with your crypto wallet (where you hold your GLQ tokens) and sign a transaction to verify ownership. Once you are connected, easily deposit any amount of GLQ tokens and then run your graphs. You always have the opportunity to withdraw tokens back to your wallet.

## What is a node and how much does it cost?

A node (blocks) is what graphs are made of — it describes the structure of your execution path. We have a pre-built set of nodes in our [GraphLinq Engine](https://ide.graphlinq.io) you can use by passing through your needed parameters.

This means that you can launch a set of blocks on the Engine which automate a task without coding any of the business logic. To avoid having a congested network, we have to apply fees for execution (known as **gas**). Each block type has a different cost of execution within its cycle, optimized by the network and CPU consumed by itself.<br /><br /><br /><br />
